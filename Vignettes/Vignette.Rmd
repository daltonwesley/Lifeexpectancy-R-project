knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Vignette

```{r Lifeexpectancy}
summary(Lifeexpectancy)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(lifeexpectancy)

```
```(R LifeData).
data.names.vec <- c(
  "Male",
  "Female",
  "Both",
  "Country")
```

```str(Lifeexpectancy)
'data.frame':	228 obs. of  4 variables:
 $ Both     : num
 $ Male     : int
 $ Female     : int
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
